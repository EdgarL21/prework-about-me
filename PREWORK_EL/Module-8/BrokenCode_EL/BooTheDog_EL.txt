1. Indented properly so code would line up.
2. Added <h1> to the title.
3. Added multiple <p> to the "About Boo" paragraph, to separate into multiple smaller paragraphs instead of one big paragraph.
4. Fixed the <img> so the picture would show in browser.
5. Added <li> to list Boo's favorite things.
6. Changed the file from error.js to logic.js because the javascrip wouldn't work on browser if the correct file wasn't being used.
7. Added quotations marks to the words pink and click in the logic.js file, if they werent added those words wouldn't be a string.
